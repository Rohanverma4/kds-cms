## Creating a New Plugin

To create a new plugin, follow these steps:

**Create a Plugin Directory**: Create a new file in plugins Directory. This file contains the main logic of your plugin.

## Integrating a Plugin

To integrate a plugin with the CMS, you can utilize various hooks and methods provided by the Plugin API.

### Available Plugin Hooks

- `init`: Called when the plugin is initialized.
- `beforeSave`: Called before a content item is saved.

## Available Plugin Methods

- **`getContentTypes()`**: Returns an array of content types that the plugin supports.
- **`getFields(contentType)`**: Returns an array of fields that the plugin provides for a given content type.

## Example Plugin

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a plugin that adds a custom field to a content type:

```javascript
// index.js
import { Plugin } from "@cms/plugin";

class MyCustomPlugin extends Plugin {
  init() {
    console.log("My Custom Plugin initialized");
  }
}
```
